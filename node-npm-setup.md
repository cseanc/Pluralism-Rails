# Node, NPM Setup

1. Get [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) on your computer.

2. Install node. See [Usage](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#usage)

   Usually I just install latest Long-term support version

   ```bash
   nvm install --lts
   
   ~$ which node
   <HOME_DIR>/.nvm/versions/node/v12.16.1/bin/node
   ```

   > You might need to add nvm to PATH if `no such command node`
